# Naive Bayes-Text Classification with Bag of Words From Scratch

# Project Description

This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier for text classification using a Bag of Words representation, built from scratch without using any existing machine-learning libraries for the algorithm itself.
The goal of the project is to understand how raw text data can be converted into numerical features and how probabilistic models like Naive Bayes can be used to classify documents based on word frequency.

# Dataset

We use the Reuters-21578 dataset, which contains real news articles published by Reuters.
Each article is labeled with a topic (such as earnings, trade, or crude oil).
Input: News article text
Output: Article topic (class label)

# Method Overview

Clean and preprocess the text data
Build a Bag of Words vocabulary from the training data
Convert documents into word count vectors
Implement a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch
Evaluate the model on test data

# Constraints

No existing libraries are used to implement Naive Bayes or Bag of Words
Libraries may be used only for data loading, text cleaning, and evaluation
No synthetic data is generated

# Purpose

This educational project demonstrates the fundamentals of text classification and probabilistic learning models.
